# Content Based Course Recommendation System

Recommend similar courses based on course descriptions. Used TF-Idf to represent words as vectors and then used cosine similarity to get top 9 similar courses.

## Future improvements

- Add links to term master schedule for each course
- Add filters for timings, number of credits and class level
